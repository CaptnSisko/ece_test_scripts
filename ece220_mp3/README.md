<h2>Description</h2>
A test script to test all required cases in MP 3. Make sure to have the exact prompt as in the MP description, as well as properly formatted output.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Cloning this repo:<br>
```shell
git clone "https://github.com/martmichals/ece_test_scripts/"
```

<h2>Setup & Use</h2>

Copy over the scripts to the directory w/mp3.c<br>
Replace GITHUB_DIR... and MP_WORK... with filepaths to the ece220_mp3 folder and your MP3 working directory, respectively.
```shell
cd GITHUB_DIRECTORY_MP3_SCRIPTS
cp pascal40 MP_WORKING_DIRECTORY
cp test_script.sh MP_WORKING_DIRECTORY
```

Run this command in the working directory of the MP to allow the script to run.

```

To run tests:
```shell
./test_script.sh
```
<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
I am by no means a course TA/Instructor. I wrote these to ease the testing process for me and a couple of friends.
